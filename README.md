### Importing the required modules for the baseline questions:
```import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import seaborn as seabornInstance 
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression 
from sklearn import metrics 
```

df = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\kttpa\Downloads\car_data - Sheet1.csv")
